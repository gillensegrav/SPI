Salmonid Population Indicators (SPI)
Since its genesis as the Salmon and Steelhead Stock Inventory (SASSI) in 1992 and then the Salmonid Stock Inventory (SaSI) in 1998, the Salmonid Population Indicators (SPI) database has consisted of:

1.   A standardized, uniform approach to identifying and monitoring the status of Washington's naturally spawning salmonid populations of hatchery and natural-origin fish.
2.   The official list of salmonid populations recognized by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and its co-managers.
3.   A database containing population status monitoring information and various metadata relevant to the constituent populations.

SPI is a cooperative product of the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and tribal co-managers and was intended to serve as a tool for prioritizing recovery efforts and measuring the results of recovery actions statewide. The co-managers' original intent was to regularly update and revise the SaSI documents and, with the 1999 creation of the Salmonid Stock Conservation Biology Unit in the Fish Program, a comprehensive updating and revision of the SaSI documents was completed in 2002. In 2022 major changes were made to SPI's database structure and a new web-based data entry application was created. Additional fields were added based on StreamNetâ€™s Coordinated Assessments Natural Origin Spawner Abundance (CA\\NOSA) data exchange format. This latest addition is to provide a salmonid abundance dataset that contains better metadata and more monitoring parameters for more in-depth analysis.
